# pong-with-ai
📌 Project Overview
Pong with AI is a console-based implementation of the classic Pong game developed in C, where the player competes against an AI-controlled paddle.
The AI dynamically predicts the ball’s position and responds in real time, creating an interactive and challenging gameplay experience.
This project focuses on game logic, AI decision-making, and real-time control flow using core C programming concepts.
🚀 Key Features
Interactive player vs AI Pong gameplay
AI paddle that automatically tracks ball movement
Real-time ball physics and collision detection
Score calculation and display
Continuous game loop for smooth gameplay
Lightweight console-based execution
🤖 AI Logic (Highlight Section ⭐)
The AI paddle continuously monitors the ball’s Y-position
Adjusts its movement speed to align with the ball
Implements decision-based movement, not random behavior
Demonstrates basic artificial intelligence principles using conditional logic
