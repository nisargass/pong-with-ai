# pong-with-ai
📌 Project Overview
Pong with AI is a console-based implementation of the classic Pong game developed in C, where the player competes against an AI-controlled paddle.
The AI dynamically predicts the ball’s position and responds in real time, creating an interactive and challenging gameplay experience.
This project focuses on game logic, AI decision-making, and real-time control flow using core C programming concepts.


##🚀 Key Features
1.Interactive player vs AI Pong gameplay
2.AI paddle that automatically tracks ball movement
3.Real-time ball physics and collision detection
4.Score calculation and display
5.Continuous game loop for smooth gameplay
6.Lightweight console-based execution


##🤖 AI Logic (Highlight Section ⭐)
*The AI paddle continuously monitors the ball’s Y-position
*Adjusts its movement speed to align with the ball
*Implements decision-based movement, not random behavior
*Demonstrates basic artificial intelligence principles using conditional logic


##🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts
*Programming Language: C
*Core Concepts Used:
*Functions and modular programming
*Loops and conditional logic
